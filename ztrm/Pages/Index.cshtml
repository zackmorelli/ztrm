        Hi, my name is Zackary Morelli. Welcome to my personal website.
        I am a physicist by education and software developer by trade.
        This website serves as a personal blog and also as a test bed for me to experiment with web development and server management.
        Feel free to look around. You may reach me at ztrm@ztrm.net.
